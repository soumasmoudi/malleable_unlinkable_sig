# PIMA: A Privacy-Preserving Identity Management System based on an Unlinkable MAlleable Signature

This repository contains the proof-of-concept functionality of a novel unlinkable malleable signature scheme used to build PIMA, a privacy-preserving identity management system. The reference paper of this solution is available at the following link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103517. 

The signature scheme is based on the Pointcheval-Sanders signature scheme and uses the bplib python library for computations on EC groups and bilinear pairings.
