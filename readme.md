An implementation of an unlinkable malleable signature to demonstrate the usability of the IMS construction proposed in the paper "Souha Masmoudi, Maryline Laurent: Privacy-Preserving Identity Management Systems based on an Unlinkable Malleable Signature".
The signature scheme is based on the Pointcheval-Sanders signature scheme.
The bplib python library is used for computations on EC groups and bilinear pairings.
